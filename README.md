# Treasure-Hunt-App-Android-
Its an android app that I created for Treasure Hunt Event during tech fest at VIT University. 
It contains various questions which act as a riddle and redirects the teams playing to specific location in our university campus. 
Its a simple application, containing imageviews, splash screen, timers, and other basic android app development modules.
